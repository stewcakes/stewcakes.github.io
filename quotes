Philetas of Cos am I,
'Twas the Liar who made me die,
And the bad nights caused thereby.

Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do

Anything that can go wrong will go wrong

Murphey's Law

*************************************************

Nor must any synechist say: ‘I am altogether 
myself, and not at all you.’ If you embrace 
synechism, you must abjure this metaphysics of 
wickedness. In the first place, your neighbours 
are, in a measure, yourself, and in far greater 
measure than, without deep studies in 
psychology, you would believe. Really, the 
selfhood you like to attribute to yourself is, 
for the most part, the vulgarest delusion of vanity.

Security is mostly a superstition. It does not 
exist in nature, nor do the children of men as 
a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no 
safer in the long run than outright exposure. 
Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.

Helen Keller

For the masters tools will never dismantle the 
masters house. They may allow us to beat him at 
his own game, but they will never allow us to 
bring about genuine change.

Audre Lorde (1979)

*************************************************

"Son, never trust a man who doesn’t drink 
because he’s probably a self-righteous sort, 
a man who thinks he knows right from wrong 
all the time. Some of them are good men, 
but in the name of goodness, they cause 
most of the suffering in the world. They’re 
the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never 
trust a man who drinks but refuses to 
get drunk. They’re usually afraid of 
something deep down inside, either 
that they’re a coward or a fool or mean 
and violent. You can’t trust a man who’s 
afraid of himself. But sometimes, son, 
you can trust a man who occasionally 
kneels before a toilet. The chances are 
that he is learning something about 
humility and his natural human foolishness, 
about how to survive himself. It’s damned hard 
for a man to take himself too seriously when he’s 
heaving his guts into a dirty toilet bowl."

James Crumely

"P20 : The more each one strives, and is able, 
to seek his own advantage, that is, to preserve 
his being, theore he is endowed with virtue; 
conversely, insofar as each one neglects his 
own advantage, that is, neglects to preserve 
his being, he lacks power."

Spinoza

*************************************************

Some Zen students do not realize the true man in a mask
Because they recognize ego-soul.
Ego-soul is the seed of birth and death,
And foolish people call it the true man.

“I” is at home in the world when it knows it, and 
even more so when it has comprehended it.

Hegel - Philosophy of Right

*************************************************

I received life because the time had come; I will
lose it because the order of things passes on. Be 
content with this time and dwell in this order and 
then neither sorrow nor joy can touch you.
